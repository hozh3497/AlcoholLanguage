   History

------------------------ General Information --------------------------

ALC contains recordings of speakers that are either intoxicated or sober.
The type of speech ranges from read single digits to full conversation style.
Recordings were done during drinking test where speakers drank beer or
wine to reach a self-chosen level of alcoholic intoxication. The actual
level of intoxication was measured by breath alcohol and blood samples
taken immediately before the speech recording. Recordings were performed
in two standing automobiles to ensure a constant acoustic environment
across the different recording locations; both, the intoxicated and sober
condition recording were done in the same car and supervised by the same
investigator (dialogue partner). In the intoxicated state 30 items were 
sampled from each speaker (set A), while in the sober state 60 items were 
recorded (set NA; set A being a subset of set NA).

The corpus consists of 162 double sessions (alcoholized 'A' and sober 'NA')
recorded from 85 male and 77 female speakers. 84 speakers were 
recorded in car B (Opel), 78 in car A (Passat). The age of speakers 
ranges from 21 to 64 years. If one version is selected per recording item,
the total number of regular recordings is therefore 162 x (30+60) = 14.580 
(found in DATA/BLOCK10...40). 

(Note that you will find 636 additional recordings containing second (or
third etc.) versions of the same recording. To filter these select only
those recordings which have an 'null' entry in header field 'ACO' in the
corresponding BAS Partitur Format (BPF) file (*.par). Or simply use only 
file names which are listed in TABLES/CONTENTS.TBL (note that this file
also contains the control recordings of 20 speaker in block 50 and 60).
Or simply use the
Emu database which contains only one valid version per recording item.
The total number of valid recordings is:
regular pairwise recordings:  162 speaker x (30 + 60) items +
control group                  20 speaker x 30 items             = 15180
Note that the CLARIN online edition of ALC contains only the files as
defined in the Emau database.

To test for unknown factors a group of 20 speakers have been selected 
randomly from the 162 (10 female + 10 male, 10 in car A and 10 in car B)
to repeat the test under the exact same conditions as the alcoholized
test (30 recordings) but being sober (control group 'CNA'). This results 
in additional 20 x 30 = 600 recordings (found in DATA/BLOCK50...60).

Furthermore 7 speakers were recorded only in the intoxicated state. These
7 x 30 = 210 recordings may be used as additional test material (found
in PARTIAL). For technical reasons the recording meta data of these
additional 7 recordings have been listed in a separate table 
TABLE/SESSEXT.TBL.PARTIAL (see section about meta data).

All of the above recordings (including second versions, control group
and PARTIAL group) have been transcribed orthographically,
tagged for linguistic events and segmented automatically using the 
MAUS system. For each recording with more than one version (repetitions)
one valid recording version was chosen by the annotator and marked 
accordingly. Only these selected versions were transfered in the Emu 
database system.

------------------------- naming conventions --------------------

Speaker are anonymized and referred to via the speaker ID &&& (3 digit number).
Speaker IDs in the range 000 - 499 have been recorded in automobil CAR_B, 
while IDs in the range 500 - 999 have been recorded in automobil CAR_A.
Recording items $$$ are referred to by 3 digit numbers as given in the 
prompt lists PROMPTS_A.TBL and PROMPTS_NA.TBL; the original XML scripts
that control the recording via SpeechRecorder are stored in
DOC/SPEECHRECORDER.
Recording items (sound file, annotation files) contain the speaker ID, the 
session number, the item number and the recording channel. Insofar the
hierarchy as being used on the DVD is not essential to identify a
recording and may be flattened if necessary.

Example:

DATA/BLOCK40/SES4004/5084004005_m_01.par : 
                   extension 'par' : BPF annotation file 
                   speaker '508'   : recorded in CAR_A
                   session '4004'  : sober condition in CAR_A
                   prompt '005'    : "Erzählen Sie eine Geschichte zum Bild"
                                     (according to PROMPTS_NA.TBL)
                   channel         : 'm' mouse micro
                   version         : '01' : first repetition

Note that the Emu version of the corpus does not contain repetitions; 
for each recording one version was selected for the final corpus. In the 
base corpus repetitions (including annotation files) are included but 
classified by a special annotator comment: 
To achieve a set of recordings without multiple versions the set 
has to be filtered according to the BPF entry ACO (annotator comment):
If the annotator comment contains one of the strings 'false', 
'false 2nd' or 'spont', the recording does not not contain the 
prompted speech or a duplicate version. Filtering these recordings
should result in a set where each recordings occurs only once.

------------------------ signals and acoustics -------------------------

The speech signal is captured by SpeechRecorder
(http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/forschung/Bas/software/speechrecorder/)
with 16bit per sample and 44100Hz sampling rate PCM.  Sampling device is
M-AUDIO Mobile Pre (see datasheet 060628_MPre_UG_EN01.pdf); the headset
channel is captured by Beyerdynamics Opus 54 (see datasheet
Opus54_DB_E.pdf) located approx. 5cm left from the left corner of the
mouth slightly elevated above the mouth. The far distance channel is
captured by a standard 'mouse microphone' AKG Q400 (see
AKG_Datenb4120c686c18e9.pdf) as being used in automotive
speech capture, located in the middle of the upper front beam (near
backview mirror, see DOC/PICTURES). The distance to mouth is about 30 to
40cm (depending on the height of the speaker).

Speaker are positioned in the front passenger seat. Motor is being switched
off, except for prompt numbers 021-030 (sets A,CNA) and 041-060 (set NA)
where engine idles but the car does not move.  Windows are closed and all
devices except air condition are being switched off. The used automobile for
both recordings of a speaker are denoted CAR_A and CAR_B in the session
list TABLE/SESEXT.TBL (column 'ENV').  CAR_A is a Volkswagen Passat
Variant Diesel 134PS 2004 (large interior acoustical space); CAR_B is an 
Opel Astra (GM) Astra Coupe 22 AUT 2001 (small interior acoustical space).  
The acoustical environment for both, the sober and non-sober
condition is exactly the same (including dialog partner). External noise
may be found in the recordings when the engine idles (street noise).
In some recordings the noise of raindrops is audible; these recordings
are marked in the session list TABLE/SESEXT.TBL with 'RAIN' in column
'WEA'. Speaker were asked to switch off their cellular phones before
recordings; however, there might be interferences with GSM signals
caused by pedestrians nearby.

The Beyerdynamic headset (channel ..._h_...) is connected directly to
the phantom powered symmetrical input of the MAUDIO Mobil Pre; the AKG
mouse microphone via a 0dB battery powered amplifier by Bruel&Kjaer 
which only provided the necessary phantom power of 8 V. The output of
this amplifier is asymmetrical and connected to the standard line-in 
asymmetrical input of the MAUDIO device.

--------------------- outline of recording session ----------------------

First each participant is asked which blood alcohol level he/she
wishes to reach in this experiment. The allowed range is up to 0.15%. 
According to gender, age and weight the necessary amount of alcohol 
is estimated using Widmore and Watson formula and handed to the
participant.
After consuming the alcohol the participant waits for a minimum of 20
and up to 40min to avoid misleading measurements in breath alcohol.
Then a breath alcohol test (BRAC) and a blood sample (BAC) is taken from
the participant. If the breath alcohol shows values above 0.05% the 
participant is eligible for for the speech test.
Speakers are then immediately transfered to one of the recording
automobiles and undertake a 15 min speech test as described below (section
'Contents')(set 'A', blocks 10 and 30).
At least one week later the speaker is recorded again in the same
automobile and with the same dialogue partner (set 'NA', blocks 20 and
40).
If the speaker is randomly selected to be a control speaker, she/he is
invited for another ecording session at least one week later and is 
recorded again under the exact same conditions as the first test 
(set 'CNA', block 50 and 60).
In all sessions speakers are told about the purpose of the recordings
beforehand and they are asked to speak naturally and clearly. The speakers
control the start and end of each recording by pressing the space bar on 
a laptop. Recordings that fail because of technical errors may be repeated
(version counter increased by each repetition). Repetitions are not allowed 
when the speaker merely made a reading mistake etc. 

---------------------------- Contents ----------------------------------

Each speech recording is prompted on screen by a short instruction 
(e.g. 'Read the following sentence') followed by the item to be read 
which appears when the speaker presses the recording button. 
See the XML scripts in SPEECHRECORDER for a detailed list of prompts.
A text summary can be found in the corresponding txt file as well as
in tables /TABLE/PROMPTS_A.TBL and /TABLE/PROMPTS_NA.TBL respectively.

A recording under intoxication (set A,CNA) contains the following speech 
items:
3 monologues
2 dialogues
5 numbers
9 command&control (4 read, 5 spontaneous)
6 addresses (1 spelled)
5 tongue twisters
Total: 30

A recording under sober conditions (set NA) contains the following speech 
items:
5 monologues
5 dialogues
10 numbers
19 command&control (9 read, 10 spontaneous)
11 addresses (1 spelled)
10 tongue twisters
Total: 60

Set A is a subset of NA (except for one address, item number A 004). 
Prompts pointing to a picture contain the 
filename of the displayed picture as the last item in the prompt text.
Please refer to the directory PICTURES for copies of the displayed 
pictures.

Since the speakers were in some cases allowed to repeat the recording,
there exist 636 recordings with more than one version (numbered by the 
last two digits in the file name); silent interval recordings were
deleted. All versions have been annotated as described below.

To achieve a set of recordings without multiple versions the set 
has to be filtered according to the BPF entry ACO (annotator comment):
If the annotator comment contains one of the strings 'false', 
'false 2nd' or 'spont', the recording does not not contain the 
prompted speech or a duplicate version. Filtering these recordings
should result in a set where each recordings occurs only once.
(See section 'Annotation' for details about these comments.)

WARNING: Item identifiers of the sets A/CNA and NA do not match, 
because we did not want the same order of recordings! Therefore
the identical prompt can have different identifiers in the two sets.
Refer to tabel ITEMMAP.TBL for a mapping of set A/CNA to set NA.

-------------------------- Lexicon -------------------------------------

The file LEXICON.TBL contains a complete pronunciation lexicon
of the ALC corpus.
The first column contains the orthographic transcript as being used 
in the BPF tier ORT (that is, stripped by any linguistic markers), 
German Umlauts are coded in LaTeX (see above).
The second column contains the canonical pronunciation (citation form)
of the word/word fragment/non-word obtained from the BALLOON tool 
of Uwe Reichel coded in extended German SAMPA; in this alphabet the 
glottal stop is being encoded as /Q/ instead of /?/ as in the original
German SAM-PA set defined by J. Wells (see table SMAP.TBL for complete
list).
The pronunciation coding was done automatically using the BALLOON system
and then corrected manually by experienced phoneticians according to the 
BAS standard for German pronunciation coding given in: 

http://www.bas.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/Bas/BasGermanPronunciation/

Please note that this lexicon contains plenty of non-words stemming 
from mispronunciations, word breaks etc. These can be identified by the
fact that they do not carry a lexical accent marker (').

-------------------------- Meta Data -----------------------------------

Meta data of speakers and recording sessions are stored in the tables
/TABLE/SPEAEXT.TBL and /TABLE/SESSEXT.TBL respectively. These tables
conform with the SpeechDat database specifications but have been
extended by extra columns.

The following meta data are stored for each speaker in SPEAEXT.TBL (one
speaker per line; TAB seperated columns):
SCD : speaker ID
SEX : gender M/F
AGE : age
ACC : German state of elementary school (to judge dialectal background)

The following meta data are stored for each recording session in 
SESSEXT.TBL (one recording per line; TAB seperated columns):

SES : session ID
RED : recording date YYY/MM/DD
RET : recording time HH:mm
SCD : speaker ID
AGE : age

ACC : German state of elementary school (to judge dialectal background)
REG : (only for compatibly reasons)
ENV : CAR_A or CAR_B
AAK : blood alcohol concentration estimated by breath in absolut proportion (0.01 = 1%)
BAK : blood alcohol measure
GES : general condition of speaker f1 ... f10
CES : condition of speaker during the test r1 ... r4
WEA : weather condition during test: SUN, RAIN

GES and CES:
Before both tests speakers are asked to judge their general disposition
for this day in 10 categories:
f1 happy
f2 stressed out
f3 aggressive
f4 sad
f5 relaxed
f6 tired
f7 depressive
f8 desperate
f9 rested
f10 frolicsome
After the test speakers are asked to judge their disposition during the
test in 4 categories:
r1 relaxed
r2 bored
r3 exited
r4 nervous

DRH:
The drinking habits of the speaker are determined as follows:
During the interview the speaker is asked two questions:
1. How often do you consume alcohol in average:
   daily, more than once a week, once a week, less than once a week
2. If you consume alcohol, how much is the amount in one session:
   either number of beers (0,5l each) or number of glass wine (0,2l each)
From these answers two binary factors are drawn:
Amount: sparsely (1-2 units beer or wine), plenty (more than 2 units)
Frequency: seldom (once or less than once a week), often (more than 
once a week or daily)
These factors are then combined into the final three categories:
light = sparsely AND seldom
moderate = ( sparsely AND often ) OR ( plenty AND seldom )
heavy = often AND plenty

--------------------- Annotation ----------------- ------------------

Orthographic transcripts and phonemic segmentation are stored in 
BAS Partitur Format (BPF) files with the same name as the signal files
but extension '*.par'.
Cloned versions of the segmentation are also stored in praat TextGrid
files (extension *.TextGrid) and in legacy Emu hierarchical database files 
stored in EMU/LAB (Emu template in /EMU/ALC.TPL) and in emuDB *_annot.json 
files in EMU/ALC_emuDB (both only on volume 1)
Note that only recordings containing speech have been annotated and 
therefore have annotations files.

BPF
The BAS Partitur Format is a simple but effective way to represent
symbolic (discrete) labels (categories together with their time
information) aligned to a physical signal. 

The main (and up-to-date) documentation can be found in
www.bas.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasFormatseng.html
(a copy of this page at the time of distribution can be found
in PARDOC/BasFormatseng.html).

The BPF files of ALC contain the following standard tiers:
ORT : orthographic transcript without additional markers;
      words transcribed as in LEXICON.TBL; hesitations; word fragments
      without marker; articulatory noise as '#GARBAGE#'
TRN : manual utterance segmentation together with full transcript
      (see transcript conventions below)
      To access linguistic and para-linguistic markers you have to 
      analyse this tier.
KAN : canonical pronunciation in extended German SAM-PA as described in 
      /TABLE/SAMPA.TBL; pronuciations derived from LEXICON.TBL. 
MAU : automatic phonemic segmentation (produced by MAUS)
      (see http://www.bas.uni-muenchen.de/forschung/Verbmobil/VM14.7eng.html) 

Transcript Conventions
Only the headset channel was transcribed; therefore all BPF files 
(and TextGrid, EMU files) in ALC are of channel '..._h_...'.
The orthographic transcript (as given in the TRN tier) follows the 
SpeechDat convention extended by some necessary additional markers 
as used in the Verbmobil transliterations:

Only proper names and nouns are transcribed with initial capital
letters; punctuation are omitted; no other non-ASCII-7 characters than 
'äüöÄÜÖß' are allowed (that is for instance French accents are ignored),
these are coded in LaTeX to achieve true 7-bit-ASCCI encoding:
ä : "a
ü : "u
ö : "o
Ä : "A
Ü : "U
Ö : "O
ß : "s

Spelling : capital single letters (a phoneme that is not spelled is 
	transcribed as single small letter, e.g. '+/#k/+ Tupfenkopftuch'

Mispronunciation/break : leading '#' followed by a close transcript of
	what was spoken (this is usually not a valid German word!)
	'#' will also be used in words that deviate from the prompt
	text but form a valid (other word). '#' will not be used for 
	inserted words.
	Examples:
	'#Tupfentopftuch' (instead of 'Tupfenkopftuch')
	'#Kupferkoch' (instead of 'Kupferkochtopf', word interupt)
	'M A #T K T G R A I T Z' (instead of 'M A R K T G R A I T Z')
	'-/#k/- Tupfenkopftuch' (word interupt together with repair)
        
Dialectal variant: marked by a leading '*' followed by the correct form
        e.g. 'hamma' is transcribed as '*haben *wir'
             ''nem' ist transcribed as '*einem'

Unintelligible word: '**'

Stutter/repeat : repeat of one or more words
        e.g. 'ich wollte +/das/+ +/das/+ das Mikro nehmen'
             '+/ich wollte/+ ich wollte das Mikro nehmen'

False start/repair : speaker breaks and starts again or repairs
        e.g. 'ich -/wollte #eigen/- <hm> bin schon fast am Ende'
             '-/ich wollte/- ich sollte das Mikro nehmen'

Hesitations: '<"ah>' (voiced), '<hm>' (nasal), '<"ahm>' (voiced-nasal),
        '<hes>' others

Noises : '[sta]' stationary noise (only at begin of transcript)
        '[int]' transient noise at the location between words
        (overlapping noise is ignored, as well as crosstalk)
        '[spk]' speaker noise (cough, laugh etc.) 

Lengthening : lengthened grapheme followed by '<Z>'
        e.g. 'wei<Z>"s nicht' 

Pauses : short pause '<P>' (<1sec), long pause '<PP>' (>1sec)
        (initial and final pauses are not labeled)

Word interrupt : '..._ _..., 
        e.g. 'ver_<"ah>_storben'

Irregularities : the number of audible irregularities # are coded in the
	transcript initial tag '[v#]'
	irregularities were counted for a subset of ALC only:
	tongue twisters, read car commands, monologues, dialogues.
	Items 002,003,005,007,010,012,014,016,018,020,021,023,024,029 in set A 
	Items 002,003,005,007,010,012,014,016,018,020,022,023,025,027,
	030,032,034,036,038,040,041,044,050,051,052,056,057,058,059   in set NA.
	All other items have the number # = 9999.
	This number is also stored in the BPF header under the key 'STT'.
	Irregularities are defines as:
	- word deletion/insertion/replacement/switch
	- phone/phone-cluster deletion/insertion/replacement/switch
        - stutter
	- repair
	- word break (if not within a repair)
	- long pauses

Aside from the transcript the annotator judged the level of intoxication
individually for each recording into 3 categories: normal (1), light (2) 
and heavy (3). This value is also given in BPF header under the key
'AAL'.

A free comment could be added to each transcript by the annotator; the
comment is stored in the BPF header under the key 'ACO':
Recordings that contain completely other speech than required by the 
prompt were marked with the string 'false' in the annotator comment.
(Care has been taken during recording that there exist always at least
one version with the required prompt text!)
Identical second recordings (versions) are marked with the string 
'false second'.
Recordings that contain spontaneous speech instead of the
prompted speech are marked with the string 'spont', e.g. 
'achso das habe ich ja schon gesagt'
Recordings that contain the prompted text and some additional speech
are not marked but the added speech is contained in the transcript, 
e.g. 'Hermenegildisstrasse oh gott oh gott'.

As mentioned earlier, filtering the total set of annotations for 
annotator comments 'false, 'false 2nd' and 'spont' should result 
in a set where each recording occurs exactly once and this recording 
must contain the prompted text.
This filtering has for instance been applied to the Emu database
(see next section).

To summarize:
To achieve a set of exactly 30+60 recordings per speaker
- use only recordings where a BPF *.par or a *.TextGrid file exists,
- from these discard all multiple versions that carry the entries
  ACO: false
  ACO: false 2nd
  ACO: spont
  in the BPF file header (*.par).
or use the pre-filtered amuDB set stored in /EMU/ALC_emuDB on volume 1.

------------------- EMU database (only on volume 1) ---------------------

Emu is an open-source database tool for speech corpora (see
http://emu.sourceforge.net). The subdir /EMU contains a legacy Emu template
file for the ALC corpus as well as a legary Emu database label files in 
/EMU/LAB. A more current emuDB version can be found in /EMU/ALC_emuDB.
Both Emu databases contain only one recording version and one
label file (see remarks about annotator comments in the previous section).

To use the legacy Emu DB you will have to perform the following steps:
(But please note that legacy Emu is no longer supported and you will 
probably not succeed installing the system on your machine; better
use the new emuR version; see below)
- install Emu on your system (http://emu.sourceforge.net)
- place the template file /EMU/ALC.TPL into a dir where your Emu 
  installation stores template files (you can add another such dir by using 
  the Emu options File / emu-conf Editor) -> The name 'ALC' should appear
  in the left databases windows of Emu
- Open the template by marking 'ALC' and select the Emu option 
  Template Operations / Edit template
- In the template editor window go to tab 'Levels' and modify the 
  entry 'Path for hlb files' according to the location where you have 
  stored the /EMU/LAB hierarchy on your system
- Go to tab 'Labfiles' and modify the path entry of type 'SEGMENT'
  accordingly.
- Go to tab 'Tracks' and modify the path entry of track 'samples'
  to the location where you have stored the ALC corpus on your system.
- Save the changes in your template file
- Double click on 'ALC' in your databases windows of Emu
  -> Emu now searches for signal and Emu label files and displays a list
  of found signal files in the right 'Utterances' window of Emu; this 
  may take some time depending on your system.
  You will see a list of '.._h_..' and '..._m_..' file specifiers; only 
  headset channel '..._h_...) wil have a proper Emu hierarchy and 
  segmentation file.
- Double click on one '.._h_..' entry and you will see the Emu editor
  window displaying the signal, the spectrogram and the phonemic 
  segmentation.
- Click on 'Show Hierarchy' and you will see the label structure of 
  this recording.

To use the newer emuDB version do the following:
- install R language on your machine
- start R and install the R package 'emuR' fom CRAN (install.packages())
- Load emuR package: library(emuR)
- Copy the dir EMU/ALC_emuDB to some location <AlcEmuDir> on your 
machine
- Load the emuR DB in R: alc = load_emuDB("<AlcEmuDir>/ALC_emuDB")
- get familliar with the emuR package: vignettes("emuDB_intro") 

Emu Hierarchy of ALC

The top level 'utterance' (value is the file name without extension)
contains the total recording exclusive the 
initial and final silence interval. Attached to this level is a number
of 'labels' (Emu terminology) that contain useful meta information 
about this recording. The labels, their meaning and possible values are:

spn        : speaker ID 001 - 999
utt        : utterance ID = signalfile name without '_h_00'
o_utt      : utterance of corresponding item in other set (A o. NA) or 'null'
item       : item number 001 - 060
o_item     : item number in corresponding other set (A o. NA) or 'null'
alc        : ialcoholisation a = set A | na = set NA
sex        : F|M
age        : 22 - 75
acc        : state code of primary school e.g. BY
drh        : drinking habits = light | moderate | heavy
aak        : breath alcohol concentration as float, e.g. 0.001 = 0.1% or '???'
bak        : blood alcohol concentration
ges        : general disposition, see BPF entry GES
ces        : disposition during recording , see BPF entry CES
wea        : weather = SUN | RAIN
irreg      : string containing the counts of 9 types of labeled irregularities
             "i1|i2|i3|i4|i5|i6|i7|i8|i9"  with
             i1 : sum of 'irregularities' in this recording (see section 
                  'annotation' for a detailed definition of this count)
             i2 : number of hesitations
             i3 : number of pauses < 1sec
             i4 : number of pauses > 1sec
             i5 : number of prolonged/delayed phones
             i6 : number of pronunciation errors
             i7 : number of repetitions/stutter
             i8 : number of repairs
             i9 : number of interupted words, e.g. 'Haus_<"ah>_mann'
anncom     : comment of annotators
specom     : comment about the speaker (e.g. pathological)
f0_uttlist : internal subset coding
type       : speech type
             R/E/M/D/L  = Read / Elicited / Monologue / Dialogue / List
content    : speech content type
             A/P/Q/N/R/C/S/T = Address / Picture / Question / Number / 
                         Read Command / Spont. Command /
                         Spelling / Tongue twister

The second level contains the orthographic transcript and attached to 
it a canonical pronunciation as in the BPF tiers ORT and KAN

The third level contains the phonemic segments as in BPF tier MAU.

------------- Interspeech 2011 Speaker State Challenge -----------------

The ALC was used in the official Interspeech 2011 Speaker State Challenge
organized by B. Schuller et al (see overview about the challenge in 
DOC/PAPERS/INTERSPEECH2011SCHULLER.PDF; see summarized recognition results of 
participants in DOC/IS2011CHALLENGE/RESULTS.PDF; 
see individual studies in DOC/PAPERS/INTERSPEECH2011CHALLENGE).
To mask the (hidden) test set from participants, the item numbers and 
speaker IDs were scrambled for all data sets used in the challenge. Therefore
the file naming in the challenge does not conform with the file naming 
of the original corpus.
Also, to simplify the task only a binary distinction between BAC>0.5permil 
(class alcoholised) and BAC<0.5permil (class sober) were used; this 
resulted in 154 speakers total, distributed into the speaker disjunctive 
and gender balanced sets training (60), development (44) and test (50).

To allow users of ALC to replicate the challenge, the original mapping lists
and documentation files are stored in the subdir DOC/IS2011CHALLENGE
See the README there for further details.

--------------------------- Known Errors -------------------------------

- Phonemic segmentation of dialogues
  Since the dialogue recordings contain the voice of the speaker as well
  as the voice of the interviewer, the MAUS segmentation (BPF tier MAU,
  EMU files *.phonetic) for these recordings is not reliable. We are 
  planning to re-furbish the MAUS program to cope with these crosstalk
  problems in the future.
- one address (prompt item 004) in the A set does not occur in the NA
  set.

Probably plenty more; please report bugs to bas@bas.uni-muenchen.de.
