# AlcoholLanguage
My python notebook on an alcohol intoxication analysis &amp; detection project. This work has been presented in SEFOS 2019: https://my.eventbuizz.com/event/1st-international-seminar-on-the-foundations-of-speech----breathing--pausing--and-the-voice/detail  and the paper is linked in my LinkedIn home page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhangho/

The documentation of the data I used can be found here: https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasALCeng.html

In this project, I explore the pausing and disfluency pattern in spontaneous speech produced from same speakers in sober and intoxicated states. The code is in a yet-to-be organized jupyter notebook. Will clean it up soon...
