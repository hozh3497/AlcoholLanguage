My python notebook on an alcohol intoxication analysis &amp; detection project

The documentation of the data I used can be found here: https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasALCeng.html

In this project, I explore the pausing and disfluency pattern in spontaneous speech produced from same speakers in sober and intoxicated states. The code is in a yet-to-be organized jupyter notebook. Will clean it up soon...
